# Brain Tumor Identification and Classification from MRI images using Deep learning.

This project employs OpenCV
library to perform two key tasks: first, it detects the presence of brain tumors in individuals by analyzing medical images. Second, it goes beyond detection to classify the specific type of tumor present. Thus aiding in early diagnosis and precise
classification of brain tumors, enhancing medical treatment strategies

## Dataset
This dataset contains 7023 images of human brain MRI images which are classified into 4 classes: 
1.  glioma
2.  meningioma
3.  no tumor and
4.  pituitary.
